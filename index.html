              Every smartphone has the ability to transcribe what you say into
              text format. This is how Siri and other assistants can write and
              send texts for you. Your voice can be listened to, recorded,
              transcribed, and stored for later use by the government,
              artificial intelligence developers, and/or advertisers.
